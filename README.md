# Guess the Number Game

- This is a simple number guessing game that offers two options for play. In the first option, the player has to guess the number chosen by the computer with clues on whether each guess by the player is too high or too low. The player also has a limited number of guesses that they can make. In the second option, the computer tries to guess the number on the mind of the player, where the player is asked to confirm if the number is too high, too low or accurate, serving as clues for the computer to be able to tell if its guess is correct or not.

- The maximum number of guesses that a player has is 5 for the first option and 5 seconds for the second option. Upon running the code, the user has the option to select which mode of play they would like. The first mode consists of the player guessing the computer's number, and the second mode is vice versa. After each play, the user has the option to select the desired mode of play or quit the game. The code can handle value errors, ensuring that the user only inputs valid integers.
